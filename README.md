# BTT-RST-Suspension-repair
These repository is to motivate makers hackers to try to repair their gear !

## History
I am a optimistic person, and when i have a problem i try to change the view perspective to see what i can gain with the opportunity. In the last friday  5/07/2018 i had a car accident and i have damage hard may car, then i had to change my ride to work, i have decided that i will go with my BTT bike.
My bike is known by my friends, for having the worst treatment ever, and i think that they are right! but i need i ride to make 40km for more or less 3 weeks.
The problem is that i have to many faulty slack like 5mm when  i brake my suspension go back alot :D

## Disassemble
When i disassemble i have seen the real problem of 5000km and 10 years of use of a ridiculous low end suspension of RST, i had at least 1.5kg of dirt and a kind of paste and grease inside the suspension, i saw that i have a very exhausted top bushing and i have to change it!
Before i clean it i started to model the new bushings!

## Modeling

I have used the Fusion 360 because is parametric and everyone can use it or export the files and use wherever they want.
